# OOMOL Connect

OOMOL Connect is a local-first connector and action server for browsing app/action catalogs,
configuring local credentials, testing actions, and exposing actions to agents through HTTP and MCP.

The project is built for agent integrations: keep credentials local, expose typed app actions, and
run those actions through direct HTTP calls or MCP-compatible agents.

Instead of giving agents raw provider tokens, OOMOL Connect gives them action schemas and a local
execution boundary.

## What Is Included

- Local app and action catalog browsing
- Local credential configuration
- SQLite-backed local runtime storage
- Action execution through HTTP
- MCP endpoint and tool metadata for agents
- Optional bearer-token gate for local HTTP and MCP access
- Optional action allow/block policy for agent execution
- OpenAPI reference at `/docs`
- A Vite local console under `web/`
- Provider definitions that can be catalog-only or locally executable
- Lazy provider executor loading

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run generate:catalog
npm test
npm run dev
```

Open the API reference:

```text
http://localhost:3000/docs
```

Try a Hacker News action:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/actions/hackernews.get_top_stories/execute \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input":{}}'
```

To serve the local web console from the same runtime, build it first:

```bash
npm run build:web
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Runtime state is stored in `./data/connect.sqlite` by default. Use `OOMOL_CONNECT_DATA_DIR` to point
the local database somewhere else.

Set `OOMOL_CONNECT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to encrypt stored credentials and OAuth client secrets.
Set `OOMOL_CONNECT_API_TOKEN` to require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for API and MCP requests.
Use `OOMOL_CONNECT_ALLOWED_ACTIONS` and `OOMOL_CONNECT_BLOCKED_ACTIONS` to constrain which actions
agents can execute.

```

## Development

```bash
npm run generate:catalog
npm run lint
npm run format
npm test
npm run build
```

Formatting and linting use `oxfmt` and `oxlint`.

## Adding Providers

Provider code lives under `src/providers/<service>`.

Use the provider contribution skill:

[.codex/skills/add-provider/SKILL.md](.codex/skills/add-provider/SKILL.md)

Typical provider workflow:

```bash
npm run generate:catalog
npm test
npm run build
```

Provider definitions generate catalog JSON. Provider executors are loaded only when one of that
provider's actions is executed.

## API

The local server currently exposes:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /api/apps`
- `GET /api/apps/:service`
- `GET /api/actions`
- `GET /api/actions/:actionId`
- `POST /api/actions/:actionId/execute`
- `GET /api/connections`
- `POST /api/connections/:service/no-auth`
- `PUT /api/connections/:service/api-key`
- `PUT /api/connections/:service/custom-credential`
- `POST /api/connections/:service/oauth/start`
- `DELETE /api/connections/:service`
- `GET /api/oauth/configs`
- `PUT /api/oauth/configs/:service`
- `DELETE /api/oauth/configs/:service`
- `GET /oauth/callback/:service`
- `GET /api/runs`
- `POST /mcp`
- `GET /mcp/tools`
- `GET /openapi.json`

Credential request fields are declared by each provider's catalog `auth` metadata. The runtime
rejects unknown credential fields and required fields with empty values so local scripts, future UI
forms, and provider definitions stay aligned.
