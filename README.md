OpenConnector is an open-source auth gateway that connects 800+ providers, supports
Cloudflare-compatible deployment, and provides 8,000+ prebuilt Actions that AI agents can call
directly through the [Connector SDK](https://github.com/oomol-lab/connector-sdk),
MCP, and HTTP.

OpenConnector does more than store provider credentials. The gateway, provider catalog, and Action
executors are open source, so developers can self-host the runtime, inspect every Action contract,
and give agents a controlled way to work with real SaaS products without rebuilding each integration
from scratch.

This repository is the open-source migration of oomol's broader connector catalog. The commercial
SaaS version already supports 1,000+ SaaS providers; the open-source catalog currently includes
800+ providers and is expanding as we migrate more integrations into maintainable open-source
provider definitions and executors.

[oo CLI](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oo-cli) support for the open-source runtime is in the same
migration path from the commercial version and is targeted for mid-July 2026. Until then, use the
SDK, MCP, HTTP API, OpenAPI, and local Web Console paths below.

## Why OpenConnector

- [800+ providers and 8,000+ prebuilt Actions](docs/providers.md) across SaaS products such as
  GitHub, Gmail, Notion, BigQuery, Google Analytics, Supabase, Airtable, Slack, and more.
- Open-source auth gateway for API keys, OAuth2, custom credentials, and no-auth providers.
- Open-source Action layer with prebuilt request/response schemas and lazy-loaded executors.
- Cloudflare-compatible runtime for fast self-hosted deployment on Workers, D1, R2, and Static
  Assets.
- Agent-ready access through the [Connector SDK](https://github.com/oomol-lab/connector-sdk),
  MCP, HTTP API, OpenAPI, and a local Web Console, with
  [oo CLI](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oo-cli) support in open-source adaptation.
- Runtime controls for connection identity, scopes, runtime tokens, action allow/block policies,
  temporary file transit, and redacted run logs.

## Where It Fits

OpenConnector is designed for products where agents need to act inside the SaaS tools customers
already use, while keeping credentials, scopes, schemas, and execution logs in a controlled runtime.
The hosted, private, and self-hosted paths use compatible connector interfaces, so teams can move
deployment boundaries over time without rewriting the app-facing integration layer.

- Agent products that need a reusable connector layer across work apps, developer tools, data
  systems, communication platforms, and AI services.
- SaaS products that want to add agent workflows without turning every external API into a custom
  integration project.
- Teams that want to start hosted for speed while preserving a clear path to private or self-hosted
  infrastructure later.

## Connected SaaS Logo Wall

OpenConnector currently supports 800+ providers and 8,000+ prebuilt Actions. This logo wall is only a
partial preview, not the full catalog. It highlights recognizable SaaS, developer tools,
productivity apps, analytics products, and AI services so readers can immediately see that
OpenConnector reaches far more than the logos shown here.

Provider names and trademarks belong to their respective owners and are used only for identification
and interoperability.

## How It Works

```mermaid

  Agent["AI Agent / App"] -->|"SDK / MCP / HTTP"| Gateway["OpenConnector Gateway"]
  Gateway --> Auth["Credential & OAuth Boundary"]
  Gateway --> Catalog["Provider Catalog"]
  Gateway --> Actions["Open-source Action Executors"]
  Gateway --> Policy["Tokens, Scopes, Allow/Block Policy"]
  Gateway --> Logs["Run Logs"]
  Actions --> SaaS["800+ Providers"]
  Console["Web Console"] --> Gateway
  Cloudflare["Cloudflare Workers, D1, R2"] -. deploy .-> Gateway
```

Agents discover Actions, inspect schemas and scopes, select a connection alias, and execute through
the gateway. Provider secrets stay behind the runtime boundary; agents receive only the metadata,
safe account labels, and execution results they need.

## Cloudflare Quick Start Video

Coming soon: a YouTube walkthrough for launching a usable OpenConnector deployment on Cloudflare.

## Quick Start

Start the runtime with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open the local console and generated API reference:

```text
http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:3000/docs
```

Run a no-auth Action to verify the runtime:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/actions/hackernews.get_top_stories \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input":{}}'
```

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for the full local setup, first provider connection,
OAuth flow, and runtime settings.

## Connect A Provider

GitHub is the simplest credentialed example because it can use a personal access token:

```bash
curl -s -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/connections/github \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"authType":"api_key","values":{"apiKey":"github_pat_..."}}'

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/actions/github.get_current_user \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input":{}}'
```

For OAuth2 apps, named connections, credential encryption, token refresh, and action policies, see
[docs/credentials.md](docs/credentials.md) and [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Give Tools To An Agent

OpenConnector exposes the same Action catalog through multiple agent-friendly surfaces:

- MCP: `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- HTTP runtime API: `/v1/actions`
- OpenAPI document: `/openapi.json`
- Action guides: `/api/actions/:actionId/agent.md`
- Web Console examples: cURL, TypeScript, and agent prompt snippets for each Action

See [docs/runtime-api.md](docs/runtime-api.md) for endpoint details, response envelopes, auth
headers, MCP tools, and Action guide examples.

## Web Console

Open `http://localhost:3000` after starting the runtime. The console helps you browse providers,
save API keys or OAuth client configuration, create runtime tokens, inspect Action schemas, run
Actions for debugging, review recent runs, and open the generated OpenAPI and MCP metadata.

## Cloudflare Deployment

OpenConnector supports Cloudflare Workers as a metadata and runtime-state deployment target using
Workers, D1, R2, and Static Assets.

See [docs/cloudflare.md](docs/cloudflare.md) for resource creation, migrations, secrets, local Worker
preview, and remote deployment.

## oomol And Wanta

OpenConnector is the open-source gateway for teams that want to self-host and control the runtime.

If the business needs to go live immediately, [oomol](https://oomol.com/) provides the commercial
SaaS version: hosted auth and runtime infrastructure, plus access to the broader 1,000+ provider
catalog while the remaining integrations are migrated into this open-source codebase. Teams can
start hosted and still keep a path toward private or self-hosted deployment later.

For small teams or individuals who want to use a desktop Agent directly, [Wanta](https://wanta.ai/)
connects apps through a desktop product experience and adds team app sharing, permission control,
multiple connected accounts, and workspace-specific connections.
