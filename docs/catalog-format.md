# Catalog Format

Provider definitions in `src/providers/<service>/definition.ts` are the source of truth.
Catalog JSON in `catalog/apps` is generated and used by the server at startup.

Provider executors live in `src/providers/<service>/executors.ts` and are loaded only when an action is executed.

Do not hand-edit generated catalog files as source. Update provider definitions and run:

```bash
npm run generate:catalog
```

At runtime, catalog responses add execution status that is not stored in generated catalog JSON:

- `locallyExecutable`: the open-source runtime has a local executor for the action.
- `catalogOnly`: schemas and metadata are available, but no local executor is wired yet.
- `needsCredential`: the provider needs a configured local connection before execution.
- `noAuthRunnable`: the action belongs to a provider that can run without stored credentials.
